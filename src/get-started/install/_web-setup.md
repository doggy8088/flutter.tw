## Web setup

## Web 平台設定

Flutter has support for building web applications in the
`stable` channel. Any app created in Flutter 2 automatically
builds for the web. To add web support to an app created
before web was in stable, follow the instructions on
[Building a web application with Flutter][] 
when you've completed the setup above.

Flutter 現已在 `stable` 渠道支援建構 Web 應用。
使用 Flutter 2 建構的應用會自動支援 Web 渠道，
如果你需要為現有的應用加入 Web 支援，請閱讀文件
[使用 Flutter 建構 Web 應用][Building a web application with Flutter]。
